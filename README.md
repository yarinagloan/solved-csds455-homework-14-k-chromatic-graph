Hadwiger’s Conjecture (1943 – still open): Every <em>k</em>-chromatic graph contains a <em>K<sub>k</sub></em>-minor (we can form a <em>K<sub>k </sub></em>through edge contractions or deletions of <em>G</em>).

Haj´os’s Conjecture (1961 – proved false in 1979): Every <em>k</em>-chromatic graph contains a subdivision of a <em>K<sub>k </sub></em>(we take a <em>K<sub>k </sub></em>and add extra vertices along the edges).

<strong>Problem 1</strong>: Prove the following graph has chromatic number 7 but does not contain a subdivision of a

7-clique.

<strong>Problem 2</strong>: Prove that the following graph has chromatic number 8 but does not contain a subdivision of an 8-clique.

<strong>Problem 3</strong>: In <em>list coloring</em>, each vertex is given a list of colors and must choose one color of the list. As before, we require each vertex to be assigned a different color. A graph is <em>k</em>-list colorable (or <em>k</em>-chooseable) if for any way we can assign a list of <em>k </em>colors to each vertex, there exists a legal coloring. ch(<em>G</em>) is the smallest value <em>k </em>such that <em>G </em>is <em>k</em>-list colorable.

Give an example of a graph that is 2-colorable but not 2-list colorable.

<strong>Problem 4</strong>: Prove that if <em>G </em>is <em>k</em>-list colorable then <em>G </em>is <em>k</em>-colorable.
